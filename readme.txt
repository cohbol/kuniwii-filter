KUniwii Filter is a noise filter developed and intended for use in robotics, UAVs , rovers
and others.

This filter can be used both with sensors and GPS .
Currently this filter is being used in the universal controller Flight Uniwii of Drone.bo and part of their
applications.

The idea about this filter born as a study from the Kalman filter where KUniwii is a more stable , soft and easy to implement process.
The KUniwii process continue self-loop filtration process in real time without worrying about the approach of output
to the new value or input .
